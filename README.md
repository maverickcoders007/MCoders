Prediction of Natural Disasters

Our idea of predicting natural disasters heavily relies on the data and information of the previous natural disasters that happened in a
specific area. The information may include the time and causes of the disaster, areas most and least affected, aftermath and the remedial 
expenses. So machine learning and big data analytics can be used to predict when the next disaster can strike and how effective it would 
be.

For example, let us consider a flood prone area. Consider it is raining heavily and a device measures the cm of rainfall every hour and 
compares it with the previous information of rainfall (in cm) obtained from the database (which contains data of almost all previous 
natural disasters happened in that area). When this data approximately matches with a value, it alerts the government that there is going 
to be a flood and so precautionary measures can be taken beforehand.
